# Project Summary Description

# Abstract
> Summary of the objective, methodology **and results** obtained. In submission **D2**, it is acceptable to report partial results. Suggested maximum of 100 words.

> Falar da baseline e CycleGAN

This project investigates counterfactual generation for pneumonia in chest X-ray images as a tool for data augmentation and explainability. Using the NIH Chest X-ray dataset, we selected healthy images and images annotated only with pneumonia, cleaned metadata, resized images to 128 x 128 pixels, and built patient-level train/validation/test splits. A Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) and a Cycle-Consistent GAN (CycleGAN) conditioned on disease label, age, and gender were implemented in PyTorch. Partial results include the preprocessing pipeline, exploratory data analysis, trained CVAE and CycleGAN checkpoints, and reconstruction outputs. Current limitations are class imbalance, blurry reconstructions, and the need for quantitative classification and explainability evaluation.

# Problem Description / Motivation
> Description of the generating context of the project theme. Motivation for addressing this project theme.

Deep learning models for medical imaging are often limited by data scarcity and class imbalance, especially for less frequent pathological cases such as pneumonia in chest X-rays. In clinical applications, this limitation is especially relevant because models trained on imbalanced data may learn the dominant healthy class more effectively than the disease patterns of interest.

Chest X-ray analysis for pneumonia detection is also challenging because high classification performance alone is not enough for clinical trust. Medical users need to understand which image regions influenced a model decision and whether the model is relying on plausible radiological cues. Counterfactual generation addresses both needs by creating images that preserve patient anatomy while changing the disease condition, making it possible to inspect what the model changes when translating between healthy and pneumonia domains.

# Objective
> Description of what the project aims to do.  
> It is possible to specify a general objective and specific objectives of the project.

The general objective is to develop a **generative framework for explainable data augmentation and interpretation** using **counterfactual image generation** in chest X-rays.

Instead of generating images from random noise alone, the problem is formulated as a **domain translation task** between:

- **Healthy chest X-rays**
- **Pneumonia chest X-rays**

The central questions are:

- *What would a healthy patient look like if they had pneumonia?*
- *What image regions are modified to represent pneumonia?*

Specific objectives are:

1. Build a clean and reproducible preprocessing pipeline for the NIH Chest X-ray dataset.
2. Select healthy and pneumonia-only samples to avoid confounding labels from multiple diseases.
3. Train a conditional generative model that uses image labels and patient metadata.
4. Generate counterfactual chest X-rays by changing the target condition.
5. Use generated images and difference maps as qualitative explainability artifacts.
6. In the next phase, evaluate whether generated images improve downstream pneumonia classification.

Expected model outputs are:

- Synthetic pneumonia chest X-ray images.
- Counterfactual difference maps highlighting modified regions.
- Augmented datasets for downstream classification experiments.

# Methodology

> Clearly and objectively describe, citing references, the methodology proposed to achieve the project objectives.  
> Describe datasets used.  
> Cite reference algorithms.  
> Justify the reasons for the chosen methods.  
> Point out relevant tools.  
> Describe the evaluation methodology (how will it be assessed whether the objectives were met or not?).

The methodology combines exploratory data analysis, metadata cleaning, patient-level data splitting, conditional generative modeling, and qualitative counterfactual inspection. The implemented models are a CVAE, a CycleGAN and classifier-based evaluation.

## Dataset

> List the datasets used in the project.  
> For each dataset, include a mini-table in the model below and then provide details on how it was analyzed/used, as in the example below.

| Dataset | Web Address | Descriptive Summary |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| NIH Chest X-rays | https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nih-chest-xrays/data | Public chest X-ray dataset with 112,120 frontal X-ray images from 30,805 patients. Labels were obtained by text-mining associated radiology reports and are suitable for weakly supervised learning. |

> Provide a description of what you concluded about this dataset. Suggested guiding questions or information to include:
>
> - What is the dataset format, size, type of annotation?
> - What transformations and preprocessing were done? Cleaning, re-annotation, etc.
> - Include a summary with descriptive statistics of the dataset(s).
> - Use tables and/or charts to describe the main aspects of the dataset that are relevant to the project.

The NIH Chest X-ray dataset contains 12 image folders and a `Data_Entry_2017.csv` metadata file. The metadata includes image index, finding labels, follow-up number, patient ID, patient age, patient gender, view position, original image dimensions, and pixel spacing.

The `Finding Labels` column may contain `No Finding`, a single disease label, or multiple disease labels separated by `|`, such as `Mass|Pneumonia`. To reduce ambiguity in this project, only two groups were used:

- `No Finding`: healthy controls.
- `Pneumonia`: images annotated with pneumonia only, excluding images with additional findings.

The full dataset contains 836 distinct label combinations. Among the selected records, the project identified 60,361 healthy X-rays before outlier removal and 322 pneumonia-only X-rays. This creates a severe class imbalance, which is one of the core motivations for studying generative augmentation.

### Metadata

#### Pneumonia patients

There are 322 occurrences of pneumonia-only X-rays. Patient ages range from 3 to 87 years old, and no age outliers were detected using the IQR rule.

![Pneumonia Patients Age Distribution](images/pneumonia_patients_age_distrib.png)

For pneumonia-only patients, male patients are more frequent than female patients.

![Pneumonia Patients Gender Distribution](images/pneumonia_patients_gender_distrib.png)

![Pneumonia Patients Age by Gender Distribution](images/pneumonia_age_by_gender.png)

**Data cleaning**

- No duplicated rows were found.
- No age outliers were found for pneumonia-only patients.

#### Healthy patients

There are 60,361 occurrences of healthy X-rays before cleaning. The raw age range goes from 1 to 413 years old, indicating metadata errors that require outlier removal.

![Healthy Patients Age Distribution](images/healthy_patients_age_distrib.png)

As in the pneumonia-only group, male patients are more frequent than female patients.

![Healthy Patients Gender Distribution](images/healthy_patients_gender_distrib.png)

**Data cleaning**

- No duplicated rows were found.
- Eight age outliers were removed using the IQR method.
- After cleaning, 60,353 healthy images remained.

![Healthy Patients Age by Gender Distribution](images/healthy_age_by_gender.png)

#### Key Findings from EDA

1. **Class imbalance**: the selected data contains 60,353 healthy images and only 322 pneumonia-only images after cleaning.
2. **Age distribution**: pneumonia-only patients are distributed across children, adults, and older adults, with concentration in middle-age ranges.
3. **Gender distribution**: both selected groups contain more male than female patients.
4. **Data quality**: no duplicate metadata rows were found, but age cleaning was necessary for healthy cases.
5. **Image standardization**: all loaded images were converted to grayscale tensors and resized to 128 x 128 pixels for model training.

### Images

The original images have different spatial resolutions and are too large for efficient experimentation with the available training setup. For this reason, all images used by the CVAE pipeline are resized to 128 x 128 pixels and normalized to the range `[0, 1]`.

## Preprocessing

![Preprocessing workflow](images/preprocessing.png)

The preprocessing pipeline implemented in `utils/preprocessing.py` and `utils/dataset.py` follows these steps:

1. Download the NIH Chest X-ray dataset using `kagglehub`.
2. Load `Data_Entry_2017.csv`.
3. Remove duplicated rows and remove patient-age outliers using the interquartile range method.
4. Select pneumonia-only and healthy records.
5. Normalize age using either Min-Max scaling or standardization and encode gender as a numerical feature. Also, assign binary labels: healthy = 0 and pneumonia = 1.
6. Split the data by patient into training, validation, and test sets with proportions 70%, 15%, and 15%.
7. Load and resize images to 128 x 128 pixels.
8. Convert images, labels, and metadata into PyTorch-compatible tensors.
9. Build PyTorch datasets and dataloaders.

The split is performed at patient level, so the same patient cannot appear in more than one split. This avoids patient leakage between training and evaluation sets.

## Models

### 1. Generative Models

The problem is formulated as a **domain translation task** rather than unconditional generation. 

Two generative approached are being explored:

#### 1.1 Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)

The Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) [11] is used as the first counterfactual generation baseline. Unlike an unconditional VAE, the model receives both the chest X-ray image and auxiliary conditioning variables, allowing the decoder to reconstruct or generate an image under a specified clinical condition.

In this project, the CVAE models the conditional distribution:

$$
p(x \mid z, y, m)
$$

Where:

- $x$: chest X-ray image.
- $z$: latent representation.
- $y$: class condition, healthy or pneumonia.
- $m$: patient metadata, represented by normalized age and encoded gender.

Counterfactual generation is performed by encoding an input image into the latent space, replacing the original class condition with the target class condition, and decoding the same latent representation under the new label. This allows the model to answer questions such as: what would this healthy chest X-ray look like if it were conditioned as pneumonia?

Two CVAE variants exist in the repository:

- `models/cvae.py`: fully connected CVAE baseline.
- `models/cvae_cnn.py`: convolutional CVAE with convolutional encoder and transposed-convolution decoder.

The CNN-based CVAE uses four convolutional blocks in the encoder and four transposed-convolution blocks in the decoder. The latent dimension is 64, the image input has one channel, and metadata conditioning includes normalized age and a learned gender embedding.

**Training objective and loss**

The CVAE model outputs:

* the reconstructed image $\hat{x}$,
* the latent mean $\mu$,
* and the latent log-variance $\log\sigma^2$.

During training, the model minimizes a loss composed of:

1. a reconstruction loss, which measures how similar the reconstructed image is to the original image;
2. a KL-divergence term, which regularizes the latent space.

The total loss is defined as:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{CVAE} =
\mathcal{L}_{rec}(x, \hat{x}) + \beta , D_{KL}
$$

The reconstruction loss combines MSE and L1 loss:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{rec}(x, \hat{x}) =
0.5 \cdot \text{MSE}(x, \hat{x}) +
0.5 \cdot \text{L1}(x, \hat{x})
$$
This combination was chosen because MSE penalizes larger pixel-level errors, while L1 helps preserve sharper intensity differences and is less sensitive to outliers. Since chest X-rays are grayscale images normalized to `[0, 1]`, both terms are computed directly on flattened image tensors.

The KL-divergence term is computed from \(\mu\) and \(\log\sigma^2\):

$$
D_{KL} =
-\frac{1}{2}
\sum (1 + \log\sigma^2 - \mu^2 - \sigma^2)
$$

It is normalized by the batch size so that its scale is more comparable across batches. In this implementation, the KL term is weighted by $\beta = 0.02$, so the model focuses more on reconstruction quality while still maintaining a structured latent space. This is useful for counterfactual generation because it helps preserve the overall anatomy of the chest X-ray while allowing disease-related changes to be generated.

**Advantages**

- Stable training compared with adversarial models.
- Direct conditioning on label and metadata.
- Natural support for controlled counterfactual generation.
- Simpler implementation and debugging for the intermediate project phase.

**Current limitations**

- Reconstructions are still blurry, which is common in VAE-based models.
- The strong class imbalance can bias generated images toward healthy-looking reconstructions.
- The generated counterfactuals still require quantitative and explainability evaluation.

#### 1.2 Cycle-Consistent GAN (CycleGAN)

> Explicar o que foi implementado no CycleGAN

CycleGan learns bidirectional mappings:

- Healthy -> Pneumonia.
- Pneumonia -> Healthy.

Cycle consistency can help preserve anatomical structure while modifying disease-related regions. Its expected advantage is sharper image generation, but its main challenge is training instability and the risk of adding unrealistic artifacts.

**Advantages:**
- Works with unpaired data
- Produces sharper and more realistic images

### 2. Classification Models

> Explicar o que foi implementado da baseline

A classification model is a central component of this project, as it provides the basis for evaluating both data augmentation and explainability through counterfactuals.

The classifier is trained to perform a binary classification task:

- Input: Chest X-ray image
- Output: Pneumonia vs. Healthy

The classifier has two roles:

- **Performance benchmark**: measure whether synthetic images improve pneumonia classification.
- **Explainability anchor**: verify whether counterfactual images change the classifier prediction as intended.

## Explainability Strategy

The main explainability strategy is based on counterfactual differences. Given:

- \(x_h\): original healthy image.
- \(x_p\): generated pneumonia counterfactual.

The difference map is:

$$
\Delta x = x_p - x_h
$$

This map highlights regions modified by the generative model and can be interpreted as a visual hypothesis of what the model associates with pneumonia. For a valid counterfactual explanation, the generated image should remain anatomically close to the original image while changing disease-related evidence enough to affect the target classifier.

Planned complementary analyses include:

- Grad-CAM heatmaps for the downstream classifier.
- Visual comparison between counterfactual difference maps and classifier attention maps.
- Classifier consistency tests before and after counterfactual generation.

## Evaluation Methodology

The evaluation will consider three aspects:

### 6.1 Classification Performance:
- Accuracy  
- ROC-AUC  

### 6.2 Image Generation Quality:
- SSIM (Structural Similarity Index): SSIM evaluates structural similarity between original and counterfactual images, measuring whether anatomical consistency is preserved during transformation.  (high is better)
- FID (Fréchet Inception Distance): FID evaluates the realism of generated images by measuring the distance between the feature distributions of real and synthetic samples, indicating how closely the generated pneumonia images resemble real chest X-rays. (low is better)

### 6.3 Explainability:
- Visual inspection of counterfactual differences  
- Comparison with Grad-CAM heatmaps  
- Classifier Consistency (predict with pneumonia vs. without)

# Experiments, Results, and Discussion of Results

> In the intermediate project submission (**D2**), this section may contain partial results, explorations of implemented solutions, and  
> discussions about such experiments, including decisions to change the project trajectory or the description of new experiments as a result of these explorations.

> It is considered fundamental that the presentation of results should not serve as a treatise whose only purpose is to show that "a lot of work was done."  
> What is expected from this section is that it **presents and discusses** only the most **relevant results**, highlighting the **strengths and/or limitations** of the methodology, emphasizing aspects of **performance**, and containing content that can be classified as **organized, didactic, and reproducible sharing of knowledge relevant to the community**.

## Experiment 1: Classifier Baseline

> Falar da baseline

## Experiment 2: CVAE Training

### 2.1 Training Configuration

- Image size: 128 x 128.
- Image channels: 1.
- Latent dimension: 64.
- Conditions: binary disease label, normalized age, and gender embedding.
- Optimizer: Adam.
- Learning rate: `3e-4`.
- Batch size: 64.
- KL weight: beta = `0.02`.
- Checkpoints saved every 10 epochs.

### 2.2 Training Loss Behavior

The training was run for 300 epochs, with the final checkpoint saved at epoch 299. The final notebook output reports:

| Metric | Epoch 0 | Epoch 299 |
|---|---:|---:|
| Total Training loss | 0.046 | 0.012 |
| Training reconstruction loss | 0.040 | 0.012 |
| Total Validation loss | 0.036 | 0.014 |
| Validation reconstruction loss | 0.030 | 0.014 |
| Training KL divergence | 43.155 | 609.191 |
| Validation KL divergence | 46.102 | 611.220 |

The reconstruction loss decreased throughout training and stabilized near the end, indicating that the CVAE learned to reconstruct the overall structure of the chest X-ray images. The validation loss remained close to the training loss, suggesting limited overfitting in this experiment. The KL divergence increased during training, which is expected as the latent space becomes more informative and captures more variation in the data. Since the KL term is weighted by the β parameter, the total loss remains primarily influenced by the reconstruction term.

Example reconstruction outputs:

![CVAE reconstruction epoch 0](training-results/cvae/results/reconstruction_0.png)

![CVAE reconstruction epoch 299](training-results/cvae/results/reconstruction_299.png)

### 2.3 Counterfactual Generation

After training, counterfactual images were generated for the complete test set by flipping the input class condition:

- Healthy \(\rightarrow\) Pneumonia.
- Pneumonia \(\rightarrow\) Healthy.

The latent representation was extracted from the original image and decoded using the opposite disease condition. This procedure aims to preserve patient-specific structure while modifying disease-related visual evidence.

In total, **9,425 original images** and **9,425 counterfactual images** were evaluated.

### 2.4 Qualitative Evaluation

**Counterfactual image generation examples**

**Counterfactual change heatmaps**

### 2.5 Quantitative Evaluation

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Number of SSIM pairs | 9,425 |
| Mean SSIM | 0.8190 |
| SSIM standard deviation | 0.0503 |
| Minimum SSIM | 0.3929 |
| Maximum SSIM | 0.9544 |
| Number of counterfactual images | 9,425 |
| Number of reference images | 9,425 |
| FID | 136.5358 |

The mean SSIM of 0.8190 indicates that the generated counterfactuals preserved most of the original image structure, which is important since counterfactual explanations should mainly modify disease-related regions while maintaining anatomical consistency. However, the minimum SSIM value of 0.3929 indicates that some generated samples differed substantially from the original images and may require individual inspection.

The FID score of 136.5358 indicates a noticeable distributional difference between the generated counterfactuals and the reference images. This is consistent with a common limitation of VAE-based image generation, where reconstructed images preserve global anatomy but may appear smoother or less realistic than real chest X-rays. Overall, the CVAE provides a useful baseline for counterfactual generation, although further refinement or comparison with models such as CycleGAN may improve image realism.

## Experiment 3: CycleGAN Training

> Falar do CycleGAN

## Discussion

> Falar da baseline e CycleGAN

The CVAE provides a stable and interpretable baseline for conditional counterfactual generation. Its main advantage is that the conditioning mechanism is direct: disease label, age, and gender are explicitly passed to the encoder and decoder, making it simple to control the target generation setting.

Compared with adversarial models, the CVAE is easier to train and less sensitive to instability. This makes it useful as a first generative baseline for the project. However, the visual results also show the expected limitation of VAE-based models: generated images tend to be smoother and less detailed, which may reduce their clinical realism.

The high SSIM suggests that the CVAE preserves anatomical structure reasonably well, but the FID score indicates that realism remains limited. This motivates the comparison with CycleGAN, which is expected to generate sharper images due to adversarial training, although with a higher risk of artifacts and training instability.

Main limitations observed in the CVAE experiment include:

- **Blurry reconstructions**: generated images preserve global structure but may lose fine radiological detail.
- **Class imbalance**: the model may be biased toward healthy-looking reconstructions because healthy images dominate the selected dataset.
- **Counterfactual validity**: SSIM and FID do not confirm whether the generated image actually changes the disease evidence enough to affect a classifier.
- **Clinical plausibility**: FID measures distributional similarity but not clinical relevance, so a classifier-based evaluation is still needed to verify whether the generated changes correspond to pneumonia-related regions.

# Conclusion

> The Conclusion section should recover the main information already presented in the report and point to future work.  
> In the intermediate project submission (**D2**), it may contain information about which steps or how the project will be conducted until its completion.  

# Ethical considerations

> Adicionar mais sobre as considerações éticas

Although counterfactual medical image generation offers promising opportunities for explainability and data augmentation, it also raises important ethical concerns. Generative models may amplify demographic biases, hallucinate clinically invalid findings, or unintentionally alter sensitive attributes such as age and sex. Additionally, synthetic medical data may still contain privacy risks due to memorization effects. Therefore, careful evaluation of fairness, realism, and clinical plausibility is essential before deployment in healthcare settings.
