## Project Summary Description

Potholes are severe structural road failures that pose significant safety hazards and require frequent maintenance. Traditionally, detecting and quantifying these anomalies relies on manual inspection or expensive LiDAR sensors. The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) equipped with monocular RGB cameras offers a highly scalable and cost-effective alternative for road inspection. However, extracting accurate 3D topology from 2D aerial images of potholes presents a complex inverse problem. Potholes are strictly concave ("inwards") structures that suffer from severe visual occlusions, lack of inner texture, and deep shadows. Traditional deterministic computer vision methods and regressors struggle to map these occluded areas, often resulting in noisy or incomplete geometric reconstructions that prevent accurate volume estimation.

The main goal of this project is to investigate and implement a deep generative modeling pipeline capable of reconstructing the 3D geometry of road potholes from single 2D monocular images. Instead of relying on deterministic pixel matching, this project leverages the probabilistic nature of Diffusion Models to "hallucinate" and infer the occluded inner structures of the potholes in a controlled manner, learning the physical distribution of road anomalies to synthesize structurally coherent cavities.

The output of the generative model will be a 3D Point Cloud representing the geometric structure of the pothole. The model will take a single 2D image as the condition/input and probabilistically generate the spatial coordinates (X, Y, Z) of the points that form the asphalt's concavity.

## Proposed Methodology

Training deep generative models for 3D reconstruction requires substantial amounts of paired 2D-3D data, which is notoriously scarce in the pavement inspection domain. To overcome this limitation, we propose a dual-dataset strategy utilizing PothRGBD and Rui Fan's Stereo Pothole Dataset:
- [PothRGBD Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahyeks/pothrgbd-rgb-and-depth-images-of-potholes): This dataset provides 1.000 paired RGB and Depth (2.5D) images captured via an Intel RealSense camera. Utilizing the camera's intrinsic parameters, we will perform algebraic back-projection to convert these depth maps into 3D point clouds. This will serve as our primary dataset for fine-tuning the model, providing the necessary volume to learn the general distribution of road anomalies.
- [Rui Fan's Stereo Pothole Dataset](https://github.com/ruirangerfan/rethinking_road_reconstruction_pothole_detection): This repository contains 79 instances with high-precision 3D ground truth. The ground truth was uniquely acquired by casting physical gypsum molds inside real road potholes and subsequently scanning them with a high-precision 3D laser (achieving an RMSE of 2.23 mm). Due to its limited size but absolute structural fidelity, this dataset will be strictly reserved as our gold-standard test set for the final geometric evaluation.

Generative Modeling Approaches to be Studied This project will focus on 3D Diffusion Models operating directly on point clouds. Unlike traditional methods that rely on voxelization, which inherently destroys the sharp edges and fine-grained textures characteristic of asphalt degradation, we will explore transformer-based point diffusion architectures, such as the [Diffusion Point Transformer (DiPT)](https://github.com/matteo-bastico/DiffusionPointTransformer) or [Point-E](https://github.com/openai/point-e).

To ensure the project's feasibility within a two-month timeframe and limited computational resources, our methodology will incorporate two key strategies:
- **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) Fine-Tuning**: Instead of training a 3D diffusion model from scratch, we will freeze the pre-trained weights of the base model and apply LoRA fine-tuning. This will allow the network to act as a conditional 2D-to-3D generator without catastrophic forgetting or the need for extensive GPU clusters.
- **Sparse Point Cloud Generation**: Inspired by the [SPAR3D framework](https://spar3d.github.io/), we will condition the diffusion model to initially generate a sparse point cloud (e.g., 512 or 2048 points). Offloading the geometric uncertainty of the occluded pothole depth to a lightweight, sparse probabilistic generation significantly reduces inference time while maintaining topological coherence.

Because diffusion models can be computationally intensive, we also propose another plan that utilizes a regression-based pipeline. This method utilizes a Monocular Depth Estimation network (such as [MiDaS](https://pytorch.org/hub/intelisl_midas_v2/) or [DPT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/dpt)) to predict 2.5D depth maps from single RGB images. Following this, we will perform an algebraic back-projection, leveraging the camera's intrinsic parameters (focal lengths and optical center), to translate these depth values into a 3D point cloud. This approach could struggle to accurately infer geometry in heavily occluded or shadowed regions, such as the untextured bottom of a concave pothole, but it offers a more computationally efficient alternative.

To implement the aforementioned pipelines within the project's timeframe, we will utilize the following frameworks and libraries:
- Python & PyTorch: The core programming language and deep learning framework for model training, fine-tuning, and tensor operations.
- [HuggingFace Diffusers](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/index): The primary library for instantiating, manipulating, and applying LoRA fine-tuning to the pre-trained 3D diffusion models.
- [Open3D](https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D): Python library for 3D point cloud processing and visualization.
- [PyTorch Hub](https://pytorch.org/hub/) / [HuggingFace Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index): For rapidly deploying the alternative regression-based networks (MiDaS/DPT) without needing to train them from scratch.

We expect the Generative Modeling pipeline to successfully infer the occluded bottom of road potholes, providing a structurally coherent and probabilistically accurate 3D point cloud that overcomes the limitations of shadowed, textureless cavities. This high-fidelity representation will allow for later precise volumetric calculations of the road damage. In contrast, while we expect the alternative Regression-based pipeline to process images significantly faster and with lower memory footprint, it will likely exhibit smoothed, inaccurate topologies inside deep cavities, demonstrating the fundamental trade-off between computational efficiency and geometric fidelity.

Evaluating generated 3D point clouds of strictly concave surfaces requires specialized metrics. Standard metrics like the Chamfer Distance (CD) often mask clustered points and fail to capture geometric fidelity on jagged edges. To rigorously evaluate our models against the high-precision gypsum mold ground truth, we will employ the following state-of-the-art metrics:
- **Surface Normal Concordance (SNC)**: Instead of merely comparing Euclidean coordinates, SNC measures surface similarity by comparing estimated point normals. This is crucial for potholes, as it evaluates whether the model accurately captured the steep, jagged slopes of the crater rather than just outputting a flat, smoothed depression.
- **Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD)**: An improvement over standard CD that penalizes points clustering unevenly, ensuring a homogeneous spatial distribution of the generated point cloud.
- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: Used strictly to quantify the absolute depth deviation between the generated topology and the ground truth, validating the viability of the model for real-world volume estimation tasks.


## Schedule

To accommodate the two-month deadline, the project will follow an 8-week schedule:

- **Weeks 1-2 (Data Preparation):** Conversion of the PothRGBD dataset from 2.5D depth maps to 3D point clouds using algebraic back-projection. Execution of Furthest Point Sampling (FPS) and extraction of Surface Normals.
- **Weeks 3-5 (Generative Model Fine-Tuning):** Setup of the 3D diffusion architecture (e.g., Point-E or DiPT) and execution of LoRA fine-tuning conditioned on 2D pothole images, targeting sparse point cloud generation. This extended 3-week period accounts for the iterative training, hyperparameter tuning, and computational resources required for diffusion models.
- **Week 6 (Metrics & Baseline Setup):** Implementation of the evaluation scripts (SNC, DCD, RMSE) and validation of the testing pipeline using the Rui Fan gypsum mold ground truth dataset. Deployment of the computationally efficient alternative regression pipeline (MiDaS/DPT) for comparative testing.
- **Week 7 (Inference & Comparison):** Generating final 3D point clouds from the test set using both the Generative Model and the Regression Model. Execution of the comparative analysis using the SNC and DCD metrics to evaluate structural fidelity.
- **Week 8 (Final Deliverables):** Final code refinements, calculation of pothole volumetrics, and elaboration of the final project report and presentation.
