"""
LAION candidate collection for the finetuning dataset (Phase 5, Pipeline A).

Finds images in LAION-400M whose caption mentions both an object and a
color but WITHOUT syntactic binding — i.e. exactly the "gap" measured in
Experiment 1. These are likely-correct images with badly-formatted
captions: the raw material for re-captioning.

CRITICAL design rule: the original LAION caption is used ONLY as a coarse
search filter. It is never propagated to the training set. Ground truth
about what the image actually shows comes later, from the VLM (Pipeline A
step 2), never from this caption. This module just nominates candidates.

LAION-400M stores URLs, not images. Many URLs are dead (link rot affects
~30-50% of LAION-400M). The downloader is therefore tolerant: timeouts,
retries, and content-type / size checks, logging failures instead of
crashing.

Typical usage is via experiments/exp5_collect_laion.py, not directly.
